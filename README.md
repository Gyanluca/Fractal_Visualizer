The program generates Mandelbrot fractals with user input. it is possible to zoom in and out and move on the generated fractal.
The application works via a Web Worker necessary to lighten the program.
it is therefore necessary to start a server (I used Node.js) to generate a url.
If you want to try it, remember to modify the url with the one provided by your local server, you can find it ate the bottom of the index.html file.
